The effect of copulas on time-variant reliability involving time-continuous stochastic processes
==============

In progress research codes... for collaborative coding, open and reproducible research.

Investigation of the effect of copulas on time-variant reliability involving time-continuous stochastic processes. 
After the research has been completed the code will be organized(?) and accompanied with a report or paper.

__Codes:__ Matlab, R

__Note:__ 
* It might happen that that not everything is included to run the codes without error. Drop me an email in this case and I will look after it.
* The codes are not cleaned organized in any serious way (yet?). If you have troubles to follow it, contact me.

Most of the codes require one or more of the following scripts, programs:
-----
* [custom statistical functions](https://github.com/rozsasarpi/Statistics---Matlab)
* [FERUM](http://www.ifma.fr/FERUM)
* [Advanpix](http://www.advanpix.com/)
