The effect of copulas on time-variant reliability
==============

In progress research codes... for collaborative coding, open and reproducible research.

__Codes:__ Matlab, R

__Note:__ 
* The codes are not cleaned organized in any serious way (yet?). If you have troubles to follow it, contact me.
* It might happen that that not everything is included to run the codes without error. Drop me an email in this case and I will look after it.
* Most of the codes require one or more of the following scripts, programs:
	* [custom statistical functions](https://github.com/rozsasarpi/Statistics---Matlab)
	* [FERUM](http://www.ifma.fr/FERUM)
	* [Advanpix](http://www.advanpix.com/)
